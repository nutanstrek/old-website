# Hi, I'm Paras Sharma!

I am interested in studying the universe with computer simulations. My main fields of interest are cosmology, astrophysics, and computational physics. I am currently working with [Prof. Suprit Singh](https://supritsinghlab.github.io/cv) and [Dr. Sunil Malik](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/astroparticle/plasma-astrophysics/group-members) on "Estimating the Galactic Magnetic Field using MgII absorbers and background Quasars" at [qGAL, IIT Delhi](https://supritsinghlab.github.io/). In the past, I have also worked with [Prof. Peter Martin](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pgmartin/) and [Dr. Antoine Marchal](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~amarchal/) on "Exploring Thermal Properties of the neutral ISM using the spectra of atomic Hydrogen" at the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/), University Of Toronto.
